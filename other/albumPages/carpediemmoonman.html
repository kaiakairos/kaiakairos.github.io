<p>i was a little nervous about this album, PPC released 3 of the songs from the album early as singles,
"another reincarnation", "march on for pax ramona", and "weird world awoke". I do NOT like the first two songs, 
which are also the first two songs on the album. The album just released however, and I have to say the rest of the album is pretty dang good.
Hummingbird, scapegoat, and concrete and cola are some of my favorites as of right now. Right now I have zero idea what any of these songs are about 
because I can never understand what these guys are saying. Maybe my opinion will slightly sway after relistens but this album has some bangers for sure. 8/10</p>
