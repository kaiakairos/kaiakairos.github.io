<h1>New site layout!!</h1> <i> April 12th 2025 </i> <!-- blog title and date! -->

<p> i felt like my old site was a little too crusty, and i wanted to switch to something cleaner. Also, it was very very shittily put together and touching anything would cause everything to shift. Woof! It was not good! </p>
<p>this website is put together much better (by my standards at least), so hopefully i should be able to do more cool shit with it !</p>
<p>now that i've set up a proper blog page though, ill be sure to start writing lots of nothing crap. always feel bad writing blogs on newgrounds if they aren't important, dont wanna bug people with nothing crap</p>
<p>anyways, time to work on other parts of the site. ive got a CRAZY idea for the home page</p>

<i>EDIT August 1st 2025: Reworking the site again. This post is now IRRELEVANT !!</i>
