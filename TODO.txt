WEBSITE TO DO:
- make dedicated pages for some of the games ( at least waxweaver )
- delete background-filter on container boxes (brightness and blur is laggy) and replace them with background-color: #000000EE (or similar, should make it work better on mobile too)
- make a real comic gosh dang it
- write a blog or something once in a while
- "other" page still needs a purpose.. ideas?
	- reviewing stuff i think is cool
	- minigame




- once website is refreshed on github, make a version on neocities and nekoweb with the funtion below
<script>
window.onload = function(){
	window.location.replace("http://kaiakairos.net/");
}
</script>

this will allow for a seamless redirect that should keep the back button intact 

notes: to test cross origin stuff, open cmd in web folder, type python3 -m http.server, and head to http://localhost:8000
