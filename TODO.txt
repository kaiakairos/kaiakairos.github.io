WEBSITE TO DO:
- make dedicated COMIC page that provides description before u click on it
- make dedicated blog viewer page
- make friend page
- art page?
- figure out what im gonna do with additional website box
- complete game list
- embed games into website itself






- once website is refreshed on github, make a version on neocities and nekoweb with the funtion below
<script>
window.onload = function(){
	window.location.replace("http://kaiakairos.net/");
}
</script>

this will allow for a seamless redirect that should keep the back button intact 

notes: to test cross origin stuff, open cmd in web folder, type python3 -m http.server, and head to http://localhost:8000
